# CPS Orders API <%= edit_link %>

CPS orders API allows Skroutz Merchants to retrieve information about their CPS orders as well as to reject 
them without accessing Merchants Panel.

<%= partial 'partials/toc' %>

## Setup

### Obtaining an API token

In order to be able to use the API, you need to generate an **API token** from within CPS orders settings
page in Merchants Panel (Merchants > Παραγγελίες καταστήματος > Αυτόματη διαχείριση).

> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
> There can only be one active **API key** per shop at a certain time.
> Creating a new API key will expire any previous one.

### Authorization

Pass in a valid **API token** in the `Authorization` header, prefixed with `Bearer `
as in the following curl example.

A specific `Accept` header is also required.

<pre class="terminal">
curl -X GET https://<%= settings.api_domain %>/merchants/cps/orders/1234567 \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.<%= settings.site_name %>+json; version=3.0' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here'
</pre>

## Endpoints


### Retrieve a single order

To fetch a specific order, you have to provide the order `code` with which you have originally identified 
your order in your shop, as a URL parameter.

When an order is in a state that can be rejected, `reject_options` attribute is included in the
response, providing all the available options for issuing "reject" requests for the order.

<pre class="terminal">
  GET /merchants/cps/orders/:code
</pre>

<%= render_recording :merchants_cps_orders_show %>

##### Example
<pre class="terminal">
curl -X GET https://<%= settings.api_domain %>/merchants/cps/orders/1234567 \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.<%= settings.site_name %>+json; version=3.0' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here'
</pre>

### Reject a single order

In order to reject an order, you **must** include a reject reason.
The reject reason can be either one of the predefined ones we support or it can be a custom one that the user wants to provide.

#### Reject order with a predefined reason

The [available](/cps_orders_api/#reject-options) predefined rejection reasons are provided in the `reject_options` 
field when retrieving a single order.

<pre class="terminal">
  POST /merchants/cps/orders/:code/reject
</pre>

<%= render_recording :merchants_cps_orders_reject %>

##### Example
<pre class="terminal">
curl -X POST https://<%= settings.api_domain %>/merchants/cps/orders/1234567/reject \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.<%= settings.site_name %>+json; version=3.0' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here' \
  -d '{ "reason": { "name": "user_cancel" } }'
</pre>


#### Reject order with custom reason

In case you want to reject an order with a reject reason other than the ones provided in the `reject_options` field,
then you have to use the reject option `other` and include also a `comment`, where you will explain 
your rejection.

> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
> The `comment` attribute is mandatory when using the `other` reject option

<pre class="terminal">
  POST /merchants/cps/orders/:code/reject
</pre>

<%= render_recording :merchants_cps_orders_reject_other %>

##### Example
<pre class="terminal">
curl -X POST https://<%= settings.api_domain %>/merchants/cps/orders/1234567/reject \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.<%= settings.site_name %>+json; version=3.0' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here' \
  -d '{ "reason": { "name": "other", "comment": "Our store is closed for personal reasons" } }'
</pre>


## Error handling

In case of errors, the response will have a representative HTTP status code
in the `4xx` or `5xx` range. The body would contain an array of `errors`.

For example, if you try to reject an order that is already rejected, you will
get a `422` HTTP status code (Unprocessable Entity), with the following body:

<%= render_code '{
  "errors": [
      {
          "code": "order_status",
          "messages": [
              "Order already rejected."
          ]
      }
  ]
}', 'javascript' %>
